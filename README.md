[Behind the Curtain](http://behindthecurtain.hackoregon.com/) is [HackOregon's](http://www.hackoregon.org/) campaign finance project. We are currently redesigning the site for better data usability, visual design and overall improved user experience.


This repo is a living styleguide containing look/feel and code examples. The purpose is the share the UI/UX team's frontend work. This repo is to be used by all those concerned to provide a safe haven for feedback, proposals and other information about the design.

Anyone is welcome to contribute by [creating and issue](https://github.com/kwhaler/btc-styleguide/issues).
